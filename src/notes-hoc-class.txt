What is a Higher-Order Component?
A Higher-Order Component is essentially a function that enhances a given 
component by wrapping it with additional logic. This can be useful 
for scenarios like adding authentication, fetching data, or handling 
common behaviors across multiple components.

How HOCs Work
Function as an Argument: An HOC is a function that takes a component as an 
argument. Enhance the Component: Inside the HOC function, you can wrap the 
original component with additional logic or modify its props.
Return a New Component: The HOC returns a new component that renders 
the original component with the added functionality.
